# The andreas08 Theme For `jj`

This is a theme for [jj](https://github.com/suetanvil/jj) based on the
"andreas08" web template by
[Andreas Viklund](http://andreasviklund.com).  It was found
[here](http://www.openwebdesign.org/viewdesign.phtml?id=2454) at
<http://www.openwebdesign.org>.

Note that this theme has been modified by me (Chris Reuter), a
non-designer and so should not be used as a way to critique
Mr. Viklund's work; see the original if you want to do that.

The original download site states:

> This is an open source template, which means that you are free to
> use it in any way you want to without any obligations. If you decide
> to use this template, I kindly ask you to leave the "Design by
> Andreas Viklund" link in the footer. I am also interested in seeing
> how my templates are used, so feel free to send me an e-mail with a
> link to your page.

As requested, this template preserves the links in the footer.
